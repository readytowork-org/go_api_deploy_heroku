# Clean Gin

Clean architecture template with gin framework, go-fx as dependency container, gorm as orm for database related operations.

To learn about project structure and dependency injection please go through [here](https://medium.com/wesionary-team/dependency-injection-with-go-fx-b698a6585cf0?source=friends_link&sk=26f391ae41c493946ee3434be2ed4971)

## Running the project

-   Make sure you have docker installed.
-   Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
-   Run `docker-compose up -d`
-   Go to `localhost:5000` to verify if the server works.
-   [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) Database Management runs at `5001` .

If you are running without docker be sure database configuration is provided in `.env` file and run `go run .`

#### Migration Commands

> ‚öìÔ∏è &nbsp; Add argument `p=host` if you want to run the migration runner from the host environment instead of docker environment.
> Check [#19](https://go_api_deploy_heroku/issues/19) for more details. eg; `make p=host migrate-up`

## Implemented Features

-   Dependency Injection (go-fx)
-   Routing (gin web framework)
-   Environment Files
-   Logging (file saving on `production`) [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap)
-   Middlewares (cors)
-   Database Setup (mysql)
